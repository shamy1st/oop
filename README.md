# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
In OOP everything is based on concept of object.

* **Object** is unit consists of Data(state) and Behaviour(methods/operation on data).

| Object  |
|---------|
|Data     |
|Behaviour|

* **Class** is a blueprint(template) for creating object. / **Object** an instance of a class.

* **Encapsulation** bundle the data and methods in a single unit (object).

* **Abstraction** hiding unnecessary details to reduce complexity.

* **Inheritance** (IS-A Relationship) one class (child) inherits all fields and methods of a parent class.

* **Polymorphism** (many forms) perform a single action in different ways.
  * **compile-time polymorphism**: by method overloading.
  * **runtime polymorphism**: by method overriding.

* **Composition**

* **Aggregation**

* **Association**
